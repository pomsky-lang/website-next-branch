Today, I&amp;rsquo;m announcing version 0.10, along with a VSCode extension and a JavaScript plugin. This allows you to write regular expressions with Pomsky, and include them as RegExp with a bundler like Vite or Webpack.
What is Pomsky? #Pomsky is a modern syntax for regular expressions, transpiled to regexes compatible with JavaScript, Java, PCRE, Rust, Ruby, Python, or .NET. It aims to be more readable, portable, and powerful than traditional regexes.</description></item><item><title>Pomsky 0.9 and our roadmap</title><link>https://next.pomsky-lang.org/blog/pomsky-0.9-and-our-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.pomsky-lang.org/blog/pomsky-0.9-and-our-roadmap/</guid><description>What is Pomsky? #Pomsky is a portable, modern syntax for regular expressions.

This is not what I expected my first blog post to be, but here we are.
I was recently contacted by a lawyer on behalf of Rulex, Inc., who claimed that I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to use the name &amp;ldquo;Rulex&amp;rdquo; for my project, because they own a registered trademark for the name. This is disappointing because coming up with a good name that isn&amp;rsquo;t already used is hard. Furthermore, their trademark is registered for software using Artificial Intelligence, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to use it for a project that is unrelated to AI.</description></item><item><title>Introducing: Pomsky (formerly Rulex)</title><link>https://next.pomsky-lang.org/blog/introducing-pomsky-formerly-rulex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 16:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.pomsky-lang.org/blog/introducing-pomsky-formerly-rulex/</guid><description>This year in February, I started a new project, which I named Rulex: A language that is transpiled to regular expressions. A month later, I released the first version of Rulex.
A lot has happened since then, so I wanted to give an update. First, the summary:
Rulex got noticed: It trended on Hacker News and now has over 700 stars on GitHub ðŸš€
I published my first two security advisories for Rulex on GitHub</description></item></channel></rss>
