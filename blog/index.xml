Unit tests to make sure your Pomsky expressions are correct
Negation of variables makes code re-use easier</description></item><item><title>Pomsky 0.10 released with new tools</title><link>/blog/pomsky-0.10-released-with-new-tools/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/pomsky-0.10-released-with-new-tools/</guid><description>Just last week, Pomsky celebrated its first birthday!

This is not what I expected my first blog post to be, but here we are.
I was recently contacted by a lawyer on behalf of Rulex, Inc., who claimed that I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to use the name &amp;ldquo;Rulex&amp;rdquo; for my project, because they own a registered trademark for the name. This is disappointing because coming up with a good name that isn&amp;rsquo;t already used is hard. Furthermore, their trademark is registered for software using Artificial Intelligence, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to use it for a project that is unrelated to AI.</description></item><item><title>Introducing: Pomsky (formerly Rulex)</title><link>/blog/introducing-pomsky-formerly-rulex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 16:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/introducing-pomsky-formerly-rulex/</guid><description>This year in February, I started a new project, which I named Rulex: A language that is transpiled to regular expressions. A month later, I released the first version of Rulex.
A lot has happened since then, so I wanted to give an update. First, the summary:
Rulex got noticed: It trended on Hacker News and now has over 700 stars on GitHub ðŸš€
I published my first two security advisories for Rulex on GitHub</description></item></channel></rss>
